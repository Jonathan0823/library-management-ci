# üìö Library Management System - CodeIgniter 4

This is a **full-stack web application** built with **CodeIgniter 4**, starting with a RESTful API backend to manage data for a library system. In the future, this project will evolve into a complete website with both frontend and backend functionality.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- RESTful API for managing:

  - **Books** (linked to Authors and Publishers)
  - **Authors**
  - **Publishers**
  - **Members**
  - **Borrow Transactions**

- Input validation via model rules
- Foreign key checks (e.g., book, author, publisher, member must exist)
- Base API controller for reusable success/error response handling
- Modular and scalable project structure

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîß Installation (From Git Repository)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jonathan0823/library-management-ci
cd library-management-ci
composer install
cp env .env
php spark key:generate
php spark serve
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you configure the `.env` file with your correct `baseURL` and database credentials.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

Update your `.env` file like this:

```
CI_ENVIRONMENT = development

app.baseURL = 'http://localhost:8080/'

database.default.hostname = localhost
database.default.database = library_db
database.default.username = root
database.default.password =
database.default.DBDriver = SQLSRV
```

Then, create the database and run your migration or import the schema manually based on your ERD.

## üì° API Endpoints

### üîç Books

| Method | Endpoint          | Description         |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/books`      | Get all books       |
| GET    | `/api/books/{id}` | Get a specific book |
| POST   | `/api/books`      | Create a new book   |
| PUT    | `/api/books/{id}` | Update a book       |
| DELETE | `/api/books/{id}` | Delete a book       |

Similar CRUD endpoints are available for:

- `/api/authors`
- `/api/publishers`
- `/api/members`

### ‚Üª Borrow Transactions

| Method | Endpoint            | Description                     |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/borrows`      | List all borrow transactions    |
| GET    | `/api/borrows/{id}` | Get a single borrow transaction |
| POST   | `/api/borrows`      | Create a new borrow record      |
| PUT    | `/api/borrows/{id}` | Update borrow record            |
| DELETE | `/api/borrows/{id}` | Delete borrow record            |

The controller checks whether the `book_id` and `member_id` exist before creating a borrow transaction.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation

- Uses built-in model validation rules (`$validationRules`) for input checks
- Manual foreign key validation to ensure references to `authors`, `publishers`, and `members` are valid

---

## üîê Security & Best Practices

- `public/` directory is the only web-accessible folder (secure entry point)
- Use virtual host or configure your web server to serve from the `public/` directory only
- Consistent JSON response structure for errors and success messages
